- Set Up WebSocket Server
  - Created `server.js` with Node.js and the `ws` library
  - Implemented client tracking and unique ID assignment
  - Added position broadcasting at 30 FPS (33ms intervals)
  - Created a test client (`test-client.html`) to verify server functionality
  - Added detailed server documentation in `SERVER_README.md`

### Step 7 (March 17, 2023)
- Added Multiplayer Client Integration
  - Created `network.js` to handle WebSocket communication
  - Implemented sending player position, rotation, and animation data
  - Added receiving and rendering of other players
  - Created `character.js` to handle character model and animations
  - Updated player controls to track movement state for animations
  - Enhanced test client with animation selection and rotation tracking

  - Added smooth transitions between idle, walk, run, jump, and fall animations
  - Implemented animation blending with crossfade effects
  - Created a placeholder character model with articulated limbs
  - Enhanced GLTFLoader stub to support more realistic animations
  - Improved character movement state tracking in player.js
  - Added null checks for more robust error handling
  - Fixed animation conflicts between modules

### Step 10 (March 20, 2023)
- Fixed Character Animation System
  - Added comprehensive error handling throughout animation system
  - Implemented detailed logging for debugging animation issues
  - Created initialization state tracking to prevent premature animation updates
  - Enhanced placeholder character with named body parts for better animation
  - Improved animation mixer with better crossfade and transition effects
  - Added fallback animations when specific animations aren't available
  - Fixed integration between player movement and character animations
  - Enhanced animation system to handle missing or incomplete animations
  - Improved module initialization sequence for more reliable loading
